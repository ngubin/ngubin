- 👋 Hi, I’m @ngubin
- 👀 I’m interested in developing server applications, browser and mobile games, microcontroller programming and frontend. Anything you can program? - So I'm already interested in this. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning SpriteKit, database internals, several new programming languages, improving my algorithms skills.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate in writing mobile applications and games, because I want to improve on this.
